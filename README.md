## About
The founders of Google used python to fetch pages to build their search engine.

> In order to scale to hundreds of millions of web pages, 
> Google has a fast distributed crawling system. A single URLserver 
> serves lists of URLs to a number of crawlers (we typically ran about 3). 
> Both the URLserver and the crawlers are implemented in Python"

I recommend reading the thesis: http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html

This project reflects my curiosity to create a web crawler as a programming challege.

### The stack:
